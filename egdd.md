# Game Name
Time Commander

## Elevator Pitch
Time Commander is a strategy based tower defense game where you pool your resources to defend the crystal holding together time and space 
through active problem solving involving clocks of various formats, timezones, and a whole lot of time goblins seeking the end of the world.

## Influences (Brief)

- Bloons Tower Defense Series
  - Medium: Game, originally browser based, now on mobile and many other platforms
  - Explanation: The main reason this is an influence is because it is a tower defense game, 
                 Time Commander is a tower defense game of a similar style and owes some 
                 inspiration to arguably one of the most successful tower defense games of our time.

- Dungeon Defenders:
  - Medium: Game, available on a variety of consoles
  - Explanation: Dungeon Defenders is another tower defense game but one in which the player is
                 much more involved in the experience. This is an influence because Time Commander 
                 will be more than setting up a defense and idling, the player is engaged at all times.
                 
- The Lady of the Lake:
  - Medium: Book
  - Explanation: This is the last book in the Witcher series by: Andrzej Sapkowski. The main character
                 Cirilla, and her ability to jump to different timelines is intriguing, and Time Commanders
                 will have the player traveling between past, present, and future.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

*Give a very high-level description of any core gameplay mechanics*

- Point and click onscreen to construct defenses
- Use arrow keys to solve clock puzzles frequently 
- After surviving a number of waves, a new level is displayed, up to three levels
- Use rewards earned from correctly solving clock puzzles to buy upgrades/disposables/defenses
- Select disposable items gathered in the game and use then on waves of enemies
- If enemies make it to the time crystal, the crystals health is drained, the game is over when it reaches zero
- Incorrect attempts at solving time puzzles results in enemies gaining buffs

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

Telling time
  - Reading analog clocks, including those without numbers
Basic arithmetic 
Strategy based decision making

## Target Audiences

Young people who struggle to tell time without a digital clock to look at.
The target age range for players is 8-12

## Target Contexts

Ideally this game would be played outside of class to better prepare students for formally learning about telling time.
Certainly, this game would be great to play during free time given to students in a computer lab. 

## Learning Objectives

- Time comprehension: After playing this game, players will be able to properly interpret the time on an analog clock with or without numbers
- GOAL 2
- GOAL 3

## Prerequisite Knowledge

*What do they need to know prior to trying this game?*

- Before playing the game, players should be able to do basic arithmetic, ie. adding and subtracting numbers.
- Before playing the game, players should be able to explain what a tower defense scenario entails.
- Before playing the game, players should be able to ...

## Assessment Measures

A pre-test and similar post-test should be designed to assess what progress was made as a result of playing the game:
  - Blank analog clocks without numbers with a given time with which to draw on the clock.
  - Blank analog clocks with numbers and a given time to draw on the clock.
  - Basic arithmetic involved questions about how much time is between two or more given times.

# What sets this project apart?

*Give some reasons why this game is not like every other game out there. Whether the learning objective is unique, the gameplay mechanics are new, or what. You should persuade the reader that your game is novel and worthy of development. Consider arguments that would be persuasive to a Venture Capitalist, Teacher, or Researcher. These might be focused on learning needs, too.*
