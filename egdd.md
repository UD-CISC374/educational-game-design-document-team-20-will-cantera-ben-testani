# Game Name
Time Commander

## Elevator Pitch
Time Commander is a strategy based tower defense game where you pool your resources to defend the crystal holding together time and space 
through active problem solving involving clocks of various formats, timezones, and waves of unique enemies.

## Influences (Brief)

- Bloons Tower Defense Series
  - Medium: Game, originally browser based, now on mobile and many other platforms
  - Explanation: The main reason this is an influence is because it is a tower defense game, 
                 Time Commander is a tower defense game of a similar style and owes some 
                 inspiration to arguably one of the most successful tower defense games of our time.

- Dungeon Defenders:
  - Medium: Game, available on a variety of consoles
  - Explanation: Dungeon Defenders is another tower defense game but one in which the player is
                 much more involved in the experience. This is an influence because Time Commander 
                 will be more than setting up a defense and idling, the player is engaged at all times.
                 
- The Lady of the Lake:
  - Medium: Book
  - Explanation: This is the last book in the Witcher series by: Andrzej Sapkowski. The main character
                 Cirilla, and her ability to jump to different timelines is intriguing, and Time Commander
                 will have the player traveling between past, present, and future.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

- Point and click onscreen to construct defenses in the direction displayed by the clock
- Use arrow keys and mouse to solve clock puzzles frequently 
- After surviving a number of waves, a new level is displayed, up to three levels
- Use rewards earned from correctly solving clock puzzles to buy upgrades/disposables/defenses
- Select disposable items gathered in the game and use then on waves of enemies
- If enemies make it to the time crystal, the crystals health is drained, the game is over when it reaches zero
- Incorrect attempts at solving time puzzles results in enemies gaining buffs

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

Telling time
- Reading analog clocks, including those without numbers
- Reading military time
- Basic arithmetic 
- Strategy based decision making

## Target Audiences

Young people who struggle to tell time without a digital clock to look at.
The target age range for players is 8-12

## Target Contexts

Ideally this game would be played outside of class to better prepare students for formally learning about telling time.
Certainly, this game would be great to play during free time given to students in a computer lab. 

## Learning Objectives

- After playing this game, players will be able to properly interpret the time on an analog clock with numbers included on the clock.
- After playing this game, players will be able to properly interpret the time on an analog clock without numbers included on the clock.
- After playing this game, players will be able to tell the time on a digital clock given that it uses military time.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

- Before playing the game, players should be able to do basic arithmetic, ie. adding and subtracting numbers.
- Before playing the game, players should be able to explain what a tower defense scenario entails.
- Before playing the game, players should be able to identify different types of clocks, mainly: analog, digital

## Assessment Measures

A pre-test and similar post-test should be designed to assess what progress was made as a result of playing the game:
  - Blank analog clocks without numbers with a given time with which to draw on the clock.
  - Blank analog clocks with numbers and a given time to draw on the clock.
  - Basic arithmetic involved questions about how much time is between two or more given times.

# What sets this project apart?

- Most tower defense games involve mindlessly watching the players defenses do all the work, in Time Commander, the player has a much more active role.
- Players will have a different experience each time they play, so there are more opportunities to learn material they may have missed the first time.
- The learning goals of this game are built in to the games mechanics, to get anywhere in this game, players must take advantage of the time puzzles in the
  best way in order to progress.

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

The game is meant for one player, the player uses the cursor and some buttons on the keyboard to interact with the system to do actions such as building/maintaining defenses, and controlling hordes of enemies.

## Player Modes

Single Player Mode: The player makes their way through three levels by solving time based problems and maintaining their defenses and inventory.

# Gameplay Objectives

- Survive waves of enemies:
    - Description: There are three levels the player must get through, each containing three waves of enemies to get past.
    - Alignment: This aligns with the learning objectives of reading time from analog and digital clocks in standard and military time because 
                 many of the players actions in defending their crystal are put together with small time solving puzzles.
- Achieve a high score by the end of the game:
    - Description: This is hopefully a motivator to come back and play the game more than once as the player can get feedback as to how well they
                   did with the time questions throughout the game and know what to improve upon.
    - Alignment: The score system pushes the learning objectives forward effectively by helping the player figure out what aspects of 
                 telling time they are struggling with and giving helplful tips for their unique needs.


# Procedures/Actions

The player can build structures by selecting and dragging them to the desired location. The player can use their main weapon, time bomb, which will
initiate a time telling based question in line with the learning objectives which will need to be solved for the bomb to be utilized. The player can
interact with icons for one time use disposable items to purchase them for aid in the game.

# Rules

The main resource available to the player are the enemies they fend off. Successfully clearing these enemies off the screen with defensive structures
or the time bomb ability grant the player gold to spend on better defenses or powerful but temporary upgrades through the consumable items available for
purchase. Penalties result in the player losing gold, and they can potentially go into debt, preventing item buying. This is caused by answering time
questions incorrectly. After fending off three waves of enemies, the player will have beaten the current level, and will have to go through two more levels, so three levels in total, each containing three waves. At the end of the game, regardless if the player won or lost, a summary of some stats is presented;
such as waves survived, total gold earned, enemies destroyed, among others. These are used to give the player a final score and let them know which 
time questions they should work to improve on.


# Objects/Entities

- A brief tutorial at the start of the game
- The players various types of available defenses 
- different enemy types
- disposable items to buy
- A player inventory to hold the disposable items

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)

- There will be three main levels in the game. In each level, the player must survive two waves of enemies which will get increasingly numerous and difficult
  to deal with. Once the third level is complete, the game is over and the player has won. A final score will be given based on the amount of gold the player has remaining.  
- Getting through each level: In order for the player to fend off the waves of enemies aproaching their time crystal, they must buy defensive structures 
  bought with gold they initally earn by using the 'Time Bomb' ability. This ability sends a bomb to a crowd of enemies to clear them, granting the p layer gold in the process. This ability is intertwined with the learning objects because the player must solve a time based question to propery use the 'Time Bomb'
- Incorrectly geusses to time puzzles: If a player were to fail a time question, for example, if they wanted to use a Time bomb but failed the question 
  beforehand, gold is taken away from the player (gold can become negative this way) and the enemies the player was targeting with their attack have their
  movement speed increased.
- Enemy Movement: Enemies come in waves towards the players time crystal and if they reach it, the crystal is attacked until the player themselves interfere
  and stop them. Players defenses cannot attack targets that make it behind them.
- Layout of the map: The player will be on the lefthand side of the map and can build a vertical line of defenses in a limited space. Enemies walk onto the 
  screen from the right and approach said vertical lines of defenses, first attempting to destroy those. The time crystal is behind the players defensive line
  and this is ultimately the final locawtion the enemies try to reach.

    
## Feedback

- Correctly completing the small time puzzles the player must do before taking actions such as using the Time Bomb ability, results in obvious audio queues 
  to let the player know they were correct.
- Incorrect attempts at the time puzzles will play a bad sound, it will be clear the anwser was wrong and occasionally a helpful hint is displayed.
- When completing each of the three levels, the player will observe the background and scenery change along with a change in the ambient music to fit a unique
  theme for the given level. Also, upon level completion, thte player will be rewarded according to how many time puzzle questions they got right in the 
  completed level.
- After playing the game, the ratio of correct to incorrect attempts at time puzzles will be displayed to the player as well as a further analysis of what
  types of questions they may have done well with along with the ones they struggled with. The hope is that figuring out areas that need to be improved drive
  players to get better in those areas, by playing the game again or studying time telling more in the classroom.

# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

- To avoid walls of text that nobody wants to read, the player will go through a tutorial which will be brief as to not lose their attention before the game
  even starts.
- Mechanically speaking, the tutorial described above will show the player how to place defensive structures and buy items with the gold earned from destroying
  enemies. 

## Presentation of Content

- To teach the core material without a wall of text, the player will go through the tutorial introduced above. The mechanics this tutorial will go over are 
  closely related to the task of interpreting times from a clock. In essence, the player can learn about the core mechanics of Time Commanders while also 
  getting an introduction to how telling time in standard/military on clocks of various kinds works.

## Story (Brief)

The time crystal holding time and space together is under attack by those who seek the end of the universe! The Time Commander must step up to defend life
as we know it by building a defense with magical powers controlled by time against the relentless waves of enemies quickly approaching.

## Storyboarding

- The typical playthrough of the game will go as follows:
  - The player is asked whether or not they would like to complete a short tutorial. If they anwser yes, the a tutorial screen is displayed and 
    some introductory information is given:
      - How to handle time quesions
      - How to spend gold earned on defenses and consumable items
      - What the goal of the game is (defending the time crystal)
      - Information about the levels in the game, there are currently three
  - After the tutorial, or if the player said no to the tutorial, the player is given one initial defensive structure to use for the first wave 
    of enemies. 
    - They will have 20 seconds to place said structure and come up with a strategy
    - The first enemies arrive, the player must utilize the time bomb ability to help get rid of enemies. This is done by solving a time question
      - When a time question is answered correctly, the player gets access to a time bomb which they can place somewhere on the field, hopefully on
        a group of enemies and not the crystal they are defending. There is an easter egg that results in the destruction of the players time crystal
        if they intentionally put a time bomb near the crystal.
      - Players also have the option of selling their defenses for a reduced price from what they bought it at. This will not apply to consumables.
    - If a time question is answered incorrectly, the player loses gold which can also go into a negative value which is bad.
    - After surviving some barrages, they player will have earned enough gold to buy more defenses, or consumable items wich will do a host of things:
      - Turn the ground into mud to slow down enemies
      - Increase the area of effect of the time bomb ability
      - Lay traps on the ground to stop enemies altogether (this will have limits however, to OP)
    - This formula is followed for 9 waves spread across 3 levels
    - Once the last level is completed, victory is achieved and a score is given based on:
      - The total health of the players crystal
      - Amount of gold left unspent
      - Total number of correct answers to time questions vs. incorrect answers

This screen would show an example of a clock and a question asking what time it is, if the player gets it right they get a timebomb to destroy enemies, or else they lose the gold it costs for the question.

This is the image where the player is about to lose the game because all of the enemies have made it past the defenses and are destroying the gem


# Assets Needed

## Aethestics

The games aesthetics should give a magical feeling as if the player is a wizard or witch in their tower using arcane knowledge to fend off foes.
There should be vibrant, light colors in the background and the structures built by the player should follow suit in looking whimsical/magical.

## Graphical

  - Time Goblin: Most basic type of enemy, average movement speed, come in large numbers, no special attacks or attributes.
  - Armored Goblin: More advanced enemy, slow movement speeed, come alone or in small groups, heavy armor and weapons.
  - Speed Goblin: Slightly advanced enemy, fast movement speed, come in large numbers or waves, light armor and weapons.
  - The Punisher: May appear once per game, throws itself into players defenses, destroying one of them and decimating, (taking 10% of) the players gold.
