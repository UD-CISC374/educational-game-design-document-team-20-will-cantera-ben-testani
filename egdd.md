# Game Name
Time Commander

## Elevator Pitch
Time Commander is a strategy based tower defense game where you pool your resources to defend the crystal holding together time and space 
through active problem solving involving clocks of various formats, timezones, and waves of unique enemies.

## Influences (Brief)

- Bloons Tower Defense Series
  - Medium: Game, originally browser based, now on mobile and many other platforms
  - Explanation: The main reason this is an influence is because it is a tower defense game, 
                 Time Commander is a tower defense game of a similar style and owes some 
                 inspiration to arguably one of the most successful tower defense games of our time.

- Dungeon Defenders:
  - Medium: Game, available on a variety of consoles
  - Explanation: Dungeon Defenders is another tower defense game but one in which the player is
                 much more involved in the experience. This is an influence because Time Commander 
                 will be more than setting up a defense and idling, the player is engaged at all times.
                 
- The Lady of the Lake:
  - Medium: Book
  - Explanation: This is the last book in the Witcher series by: Andrzej Sapkowski. The main character
                 Cirilla, and her ability to jump to different timelines is intriguing, and Time Commander
                 will have the player traveling between past, present, and future.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

- Point and click onscreen to construct defenses
- Use arrow keys to solve clock puzzles frequently 
- After surviving a number of waves, a new level is displayed, up to three levels
- Use rewards earned from correctly solving clock puzzles to buy upgrades/disposables/defenses
- Select disposable items gathered in the game and use then on waves of enemies
- If enemies make it to the time crystal, the crystals health is drained, the game is over when it reaches zero
- Incorrect attempts at solving time puzzles results in enemies gaining buffs

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

Telling time
  - Reading analog clocks, including those without numbers
Basic arithmetic 
Strategy based decision making

## Target Audiences

Young people who struggle to tell time without a digital clock to look at.
The target age range for players is 8-12

## Target Contexts

Ideally this game would be played outside of class to better prepare students for formally learning about telling time.
Certainly, this game would be great to play during free time given to students in a computer lab. 

## Learning Objectives

- After playing this game, players will be able to properly interpret the time on an analog clock with numbers included on the clock.
- After playing this game, players will be able to properly interpret the time on an analog clock without numbers included on the clock.
- After playing this game, players will be able to tell the time on a digital clock given that it uses military time.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

- Before playing the game, players should be able to do basic arithmetic, ie. adding and subtracting numbers.
- Before playing the game, players should be able to explain what a tower defense scenario entails.
- Before playing the game, players should be able to ...

## Assessment Measures

A pre-test and similar post-test should be designed to assess what progress was made as a result of playing the game:
  - Blank analog clocks without numbers with a given time with which to draw on the clock.
  - Blank analog clocks with numbers and a given time to draw on the clock.
  - Basic arithmetic involved questions about how much time is between two or more given times.

# What sets this project apart?

- Most tower defense games involve mindlessly watching the players defenses do all the work, in Time Commander, the player has a much more active role.
- Players will have a different experience each time they play, so there are more opportunities to learn material they may have missed the first time.
- The learning goal of being able to tell time given a clock is made to be a built in part of the core gameplay mechanics.

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

The game is meant for one player, the player uses the cursor and some buttons on the keyboard to interact with the system to do actions such as building/maintaining defenses, and controlling hordes of enemies.

## Player Modes

Single Player Mode: The player makes their way through three levels by solving time based problems and maintaining their defenses and inventory.

# Gameplay Objectives

- Survive waves of enemies:
    - Description: There are three rounds the player must get through, each involving a number of waves of enemies to get past.
    - Alignment: This aligns with the learning objectives of reading time from analog and digital clocks in standard and military time because 
                 many of the players actions in defending their crystal are put together with small time solving puzzles.
- *Primary Objective #2*:
    - Description: *Description*
    - Alignment: *Describe how this aligns with one or more learning objectives*
- *etc.*

# Procedures/Actions

The player can build structures by selecting and dragging them to the desired location. The player can use their main weapon, time bomb, which will
initiate a time based question in line with the learning objectives which will need to be solved for the bomb to be utilized. The player can interact
with icons for one time use disposable items to purchase them for aid in the game.

# Rules

The main rescource available to the player are the enemies they fend off. Destroying these enemies grant gold which the player can use to buy
various one time use items to help clear tough enemies, as well as defensive structures to barricade the crystal. The amount of structures the
player can have at any given time is limited, and the gold needs to be spent strategically as well, managing these limited resources are 
essential to beating the game.

## Feedback

*Explicitly describe what visual/audio/animation indicators there are that give players feedback on their progress towards their gameplay objectives (and ideally the learning objectives).*

*Describe what longer-term feedback you detect and give that guides the player in their learning and lets them know how they are doing in regards to the learning objectives.*

# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

*Briefly describe how the player will learn the gameplay mechanics. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching mechanics iteratively and slowly.*

## Presentation of Content

*Briefly describe how the player will be taught the core material they are meant to learn. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching material iteratively and slowly.*

## Story (Brief)

*The Summary or TL;DR version of below*

## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*

# Assets Needed

## Aethestics

The games aesthetics should give a magical feeling as if the player is a wizard or witch in their tower using arcane knowledge to fend off foes.
There should be vibrant, light colors in the background and the structures built by the player should follow suit in looking whimsical/magical.
